    "# Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by defining two functions for hashing passwords and verifying given passwords against a hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "`hash_password()` first generates a random `salt` string consisting of 64 characters. We then compute the hash `pwdhash` of the provided password and salt using [`scrypt`](https://bitbucket.org/mhallin/py-scrypt/src/default/), a state of the art cryptographic hash function. We use the randomly gernerated `salt` since the same passwords will later have different hash values because it is very unlikely that their hash was created using the same salt. Finally, `hash_password()` returns both `salt` and the password hash `pwdhash` since we can only check a plain password against `pwdhash` if we also have access to the `salt` that was used to compute the hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "`verify_password()` takes the hashed password `pwdhash`, the `salt` used for hashing, and a plain text password `pwdcheck` that should be verified. It first computes the hash `pwdcheckhash` of the plain password and the salt and then compares it against `pwdhash`. If both match, we assume the password to be correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we provide implementations for both `hash_password()` and `verify_password()` along with a simple `unittest` to check whether the functions work as intended."

We can either define a more secure login function that makes use of prepared statements that will sanitize the user input or we can add a bit of complexity to the hashing process of the passwords ([salt+pepper](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/3289)). We will showcase both solutions in the following. Ideally, we implement both.\n",

    "In PostgreSQL, this can be achieved by using so called [prepared statements](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/sql-prepare.html).

    "In `psycopg2`, prepared statements have a slightly different syntax. We can use the `%s` placeholder in the query string to indicate that the parameter is a string and should be sanitized accordingly. The following statement has the same effect as the prepared statement from above:\n",
