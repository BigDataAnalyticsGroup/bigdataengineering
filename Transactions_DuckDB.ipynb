    "# Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection\n",
    "In order to send queries to the database, we first need to establish a `connection`.The `connect()` method lets you decide between an **in-memory database** and a **persistent database** in form of a DuckDB file, by specifying the `database` parameter.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "conn = duckdb.connect(database=':memory:') # creates an in-memory database\n",
    "conn = duckdb.connect(databaes='my-db.duckdb') # creates a persistent database file called 'my-db.duckdb'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In our setup above, we create a persistent database. The default is creating an in-memory database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Querying\n",
    "We can send queries to the database using the connection object `conn`. In contrast to the PostgreSQL database adapter for Python, we do not need a _cursor_ that has to be openend from an established connection. The connection directly allows us send queries (`execute()`) and retrieve results (`fetchone()`, `fetchall()`). Results are always tuples, even if they consist of a single integer. We have to consider this when parsing the results. In addition,\n",
    "DuckDB provides multiple additional methods that can be used to convert query results into well-established formats, e.g., `fetchdf()` fetches the data as a Pandas DataFrame. When we are done, we close the connection using the `close()` method (this happens implicitly if the connection goes out of scope).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example shows how to query the database for an entire table."
