    "# NSA\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is based on the brilliant book by Andreas Eschbach: [\"NSA: Nationales Sicherheitsamt\"](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07D18P88V/). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of that book: imagine computers, the internet, and mobile phones developed roughly 70 years earlier, namely in the beginning of the 20th century. A special office called \"Nationales Sicherheitsamt (NSA)\" collects and analyzes data to identify potential \"risks\" for the nation. In the 1930s, the nazi regime takes control of the government and the NSA. Hence they get access to all that data and look for ways to abuse that data for their goals, especially the tracing of hidden jews and political opponents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrates the scenario described on the first 42 pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notice**: This notebook based on Eschbachs fantastic book is a **warning**: seemingly useless/junk data when combined in the right way, can yield shocking insights. \n",
    "\n",
    "This scenario is **yet another example of the highly unpredictable \"big data arithmetic\": Joining apples with oranges may yield anything.**\n",
    "\n",
    "And you do not need any machine learning or artificial intelligence for this. SQL is enough, and even a relatively restricted subset of SQL, as supported by sqlite3 and used in this notebook, is enough in this case.\n",

    "This notebook is based on the sqlite3-kernel by Andrew Brownan which is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/brownan/sqlite3-kernel). As the kernel is based on the bash shell, it will only run on Unix systems, but not on Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the kernel, just follow these steps:\n",
    "* Download the repository as zip file or clone it using git, if necessary unpack the archive\n",
    "* If you are using a virtual machine, copy the folder to a location accessible by the virtual machine, e.g. a shared folder. Run your virtual machine and if necessary start your python environment.\n",
    "* Move to the folder containing the kernel and execute the following commands:\n",
    "  - python setup.py install\n",
    "  - python -m sqlite3_kernel.install\n",
    "  \n",
    "If the kernel was successfully installed, you should now be able to start jupyter notebook and select \"Sqlite3\" as notebook type for new notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In case of problems, you can delete the kernel using the following steps:\n",
    "* Look up the kernel name by executing the command: jupyter kernelspec list\n",
    "* Delete the kernel: jupyter kernelspec uninstall kernel_name"
